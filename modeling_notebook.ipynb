However, when the hidden feature amount was too small or too large, the algorithm wasn't optimized. This was easily identifiable when looking at the actual genres associated with the top tracks in each hidden feature and observing genre overlap amongst the top tracks.

This is necessary so that there is no dimension incompatibility when performing pair-wise cosine similarity between our playlist and each track. After transposing `W`, cosine similarity can then be executed, and the cosine valus can be sorted from highest to lowest (highest being 1 and lowest being 0 in our case). Additionally, the indices for the cosine values can be obtained, specifically for the high cosine values, and these indices correlate directly to the indices of `tracks`, which has all of the Spotify track URIs. From there, we can begin adding tracks to a recommendation list, as long as the track is not already in the playlist and the track has a popularity score above 5, according to Spotify's popularity metric from 0 to 100. I decided to include this popularity metric as a factor to consider before adding a track to the recommendation list because I was noticing that many tracks that were being recommended were subjectively not good. I began to notice that most of these poor sounding tracks had a Spotify popularity score between 0 and 5, which is why I chose 5 as a cutoff. What I have explained in this segment is precisely what the function, `track_recommendations`, performs."
